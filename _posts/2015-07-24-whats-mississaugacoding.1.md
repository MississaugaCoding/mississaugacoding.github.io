[Mississauga Coding](http://www.meetup.com/Mississauga-Coding-learn-to-code/) is the first and only coding meetup in Mississauga to bring together people interested in learning to code. Our main focus is on freely available, open-sourced web technologies.

Our meetup group welcomes people of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels to benefit from the resources provided and to meet other like-minded attendees for the purpose of learning together. 

Head over our Meetup page to know when and where sessions are being held.
