It is said a picture speaks a thousand words, so it's no surprise that adding images to a web page is a very common requirement.

This week we will explore ways of coding image content, including regular images, backgrounds, and loading images automatically as the viewer scrolls the page.

In addition to using the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code concepts we've discussed so far, we'll discover some new tags, properties and commands, including:

- HTML 
  - `img` tag

- CSS properties
  - `transform`
  - `opacity`
  - `background-image`, `background-size`, `background-attachment`, `background-repeat`

- JavaScript 
  - `offsetHeight` (height of the element including vertical padding and borders, in pixels)
  - `window.pageYOffset` (number of pixels that the document has already been scrolled vertically)
  - `window.innerHeight` (the inner height in pixels of the browser window or viewport)

##Code

Any example code from the session will be posted here.
