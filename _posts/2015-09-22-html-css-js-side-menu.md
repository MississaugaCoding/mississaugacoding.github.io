A key part of any web page front-end is navigation, enabling the user to go from one section to another easily and intuitively.

This week we will talk about coding a toggled side-menu which, incidentally, should work nicely on any device, including smartphones and tablets.

Through this exercise we will revise:

- general HTML document structure
- CSS and JavaScript integration
- Stylesheet rules targeting HTML elements by `id`
- JavaScript event listeners and event handling

New things we will cover include:

- HTML 
  - `nav`, `ul` and `li` elements
  - `a` (anchor) and `h1` elements
  - `viewport meta` tag

- CSS properties
  - `position`, `list-style-type`, `text-decoration`
  - `line-height`, `text-align` 
  - `hover` pseudo-class and `cursor`
  - `transition`

- JavaScript 
  - `if` statements
