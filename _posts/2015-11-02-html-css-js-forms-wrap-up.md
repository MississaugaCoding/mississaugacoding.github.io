This week we shall wrap up our discussion about forms by looking at some other frequently used modes of form input, such as drop-downs, radio buttons and checkboxes. 

We will also talk about troubleshooting some common JavaScript mishaps, and hopefully iron out any pending difficulties/questions on the topic of forms. 

As usual, any code examples and points of general interest will be posted here after the session.
