Bootstrap bills itself as "the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web projects".

Modesty apart, it is primarily a whole bunch of style rules (CSS) that Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton put together while working at Twitter, and which Twitter then decided to share freely with the rest of us.

Bootstrap does include some JavaScript functions, and in fact you would need to include jQuery in your page as well. 

You do not necessarily need to know jQuery to use Bootstrap, but it helps, and knowing jQuery does have its own benefits.

jQuery's claim to fame is "write less, do more". It is a JavaScript library that simplifies (somewhat) what we've been doing so far in plain vanilla JavaScript: get a page element; listen for, and handle, events on that element; modify and/or add page elements, make AJAX calls, etc. etc.

In our talk this week we'll explore the reasons why one would use these frameworks, and how to start using them.

As usual any code examples and relevant resources will be posted here after the session.
