Mississauga Coding is a knowledge-sharing community. It is aimed at anyone interested in coding, whether considering a career move, looking to build up their coding skills or just for the sheer creative fun of learning how to code.  

Mississauga Coding started as a meet-up group around summer 2014, and from day one the main objective has been to freely help each other learn more about programming. This remains the ethos of the group.

We currently meet on Wednesday evenings at the Mississauga Central library branch. We suggest you check [our group page](http://www.meetup.com/Mississauga-Coding/) frequently for the latest event announcements.

Coders, and aspiring coders, from different backgrounds and skill levels are welcome. We focus on understanding fundamentals first, and building up from there. The key focus is on web development using open-source technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript and related front-end frameworks. We also tackle back-end subject areas such as NodeJS, Python, APIs and databases. This is currently the only such group in Mississauga that caters for beginners, tackling these topics hands-on and from first principles. 

We invite you to check out the [posts archive](http://mississaugacoding.github.io/archive/) on this site where you will find notes and code examples from our previous sessions. 

We look forward to seeing you at one of our events soon.
