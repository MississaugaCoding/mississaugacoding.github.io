Mississauga Coding is a knowledge-sharing community. It is aimed at anyone interested in coding, whether considering a career move, looking to build up their skills or just for the sheer creative fun of learning how to code.  

Mississauga Coding started as a meet-up group around summer 2014, and from day one the main objective has been for members freely helping each other to learn about programming. This remains the ethos of the group.

We currently meet on Tuesday evenings at the Mississauga Central library branch, but we suggest you check [our group page](http://www.meetup.com/Mississauga-Coding/) frequently for the latest meet-up announcements.

Coders, and aspiring coders, from different backgrounds and skill levels are welcome. We focus on understanding fundamentals first, and building up from there. The key focus is on web development using open-source technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is currently the only such group in Mississauga that caters for beginners, tackling these topics hands-on and from first principles. 

We invite you to check out the [posts archive](http://mississaugacoding.github.io/archive/) on this site where you will find notes and code examples from our previous sessions. 

We look forward to seeing you at one of our sessions soon.
