Mississauga Coding is a knowledge-sharing community. It is aimed at anyone interested in coding, whether considering a career move, looking to build up their skills or just for the sheer creative fun of learning to code.  

Coders, and aspiring coders, from different backgrounds and skill levels are welcome.  We focus on understanding fundamentals first, and building up from there.  

Mississauga Coding started as a meetup group around summer 2014, and from day one the main objective has been for members helping each other freely to learn about programming. This remains the ethos of the group. 

The key emphasis is on web development using open-source technologies, and currently we are the only such group in Mississauga that caters for beginners, tackling topics hands-on and from first principles. 

We invite you to check out the [posts archive](http://mississaugacoding.github.io/archive/) on this site where you will find notes and code examples from our previous sessions. 

We look forward to meeting up with you soon.
